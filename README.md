T R Ferens Interactive
This is a project to demonstrate an interactive exhibit about TR Ferens for the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. 

This will be deployed on a Raspberry Pi connected to a touchscreen to provide a low cost, in-house developed interactive.

There are different styles files as part of an experiment to see which style is better for galleries with different light levels.
The original styles.css with a white backgournd is for well lit galleries while the styles_dark.css file is for more dimly lit galleries.
