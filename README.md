T R Ferens Interactive
This is a project to demonstrate an interactive exhibit about TR Ferens for the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. 

There are different styles files as part of an experiment to see which style is better for galleries with different light levels.
The original styles.css with a white backgournd is for well lit galleries while the styles_dark.css file is for more cimly lit galleries.

The plan is to deploy this on a Raspberry Pi connected to a touchscreen to provide a low cost, in-house developed interactive.
