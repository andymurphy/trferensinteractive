			"Before the Ferens was built, Hull Corporation housed its art collection in a suite of rooms in the City Hall, shown above. Some of this collection had been donated by philanthropist T R Ferens. When the collection grew too large for the rooms, Ferens decided that it needed a purpose-built gallery.",
			"The land, the site of an unused church, that was to be the site of the gallery bought by Ferens and given to the city. A competition was held to design the gallery and this was won by architects S.N. Cooke and E.C. Davies. Construction began in 1924 and the gallery was completed in 1927.",
			"As mentioned above, philanthropist TR Ferens donated the land and gave the money for the gallery's construction. He made his money by rising from confidential shorthand clerk to become the managing director of Reckitt and Sons, a manufacturer of household goods."

			"T R Ferens was an industrialist and a philanthropist. Born on the 4th of May, 1847 in East Thickley, he moved to Hull in 1868 to take up a post as shorthand clerk to James Reckitt of Reckitt and Sons.",
			"During his time with Reckitt and Sons, Ferens rose through the ranks, becoming managing directory in 1889. In the 1890s the company expanded rapidly. One of its popular products was a laundry blue, used to prevent white laundry from yellowing, and its success led to the local saying that \'Reckitt\'s Blue made Ferens\' gold\'.",
			"Ferens had a strong work ethic and rose to the top of Reckitt and Sons. His Wesleyan Methodist upbringing was one of the reasons he used the wealth he accumulated for the benefit of others. He loved art and believed it could change lives. As a result he bought art for the city and donated the money for this gallery."
